# Wreath

A multifaceted looper for the Daisy platform.

BUGS

1) clicks when going backwards or at a speed different than the write one
2) in pendulum sometimes a flanger-like effect is produced (check feedback and (1))

TODO

- modulation matrix
- sample rate reduction
- mimeo: when clocked, there should be a way to clock the looper, speed is a divisor/multiplier
- clocked, envelope
- extend initial buffer
- link loopers (eg. play in series)
- stutter (stops and goes, repeats), drag, jitter
- more play heads
